/*  -----------
    Snellen Font
    ------------  */

This font comprises the ten original snellen optotype glyphs
(CDEFLMNOPZ) plus my interpretation of the remaining 15 letters
as they might appear in accordance with the type's principles.

The SnellenMirror font is the same as snellen, except the glyphs
appear reflected about the Y axis, so that they will appear correctly
when viewed through a mirror.

These fonts were built using the fontforge editor. The fontforge
project files are included.
