[[https://radagast.ca/snellen/snellen.html][Snellen]] is  a digital version of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart][classic optometric eye chart]]. Snellen supports the original ten snellen glyphs and the more modern Sloan glyphs. The Snellen glyphs are presented according to the original lines (20/200, 20/160, etc). Sloan glyphs are presented by increments of 0.1 LogMAR from 1.0 to -0.3. The glyphs conform to the original mathematical properties of the standard optotypes.

Snellen runs on a linux PC and may be controlled by a keyboard or a
remote control.
